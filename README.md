# Invoice-Extraction
As we know, the world has turned into a global village and most of the processes are
automated. This has been very helpful as it helps in saving a lot of time and energy. The
machines are trained according to the requirement which in most of the cases give high
quality output. Traditionally, the process of extracting information from invoices have been a
tedious task as it requires much time and manual labour. But the innovations and technology
has put a full stop to the tasks completed manually. As the data that is being produced on a
daily basis has increased people are searching for easy methods to covert pdf to excel. So our
project is basically for converting invoices to excel using python. Our project is a real time
project which is for particular customers to make their work easier. We are making it in a
more elegant and sophisticated way to extract the pdf data to an organized excel or csv
format.
Our aim is to build a webpage which facilitates extraction of useful information from the
invoices. The manual procedure is time consuming. Thus, we try to automate the process of
information extraction. For this process, we initially extract the information from pdf files in
a text format. The tool used for this purpose is pdfminer. Pdfminer comprises of multiple
features like allow the users to quickly, securely export pdf file to convert it into text file. In
case the pdf is of low resolution, we use methods like adaptive thresholding (Gaussian Filter)
so as to increase the resolution of the pdf and which will in turn help the machine to extract
all of the information in the pdf. Once the information is extracted, it will be stored as a csv
file. Thus the process of extracting information from the invoices is automated which will
make the work easier. Thus manual work and the time consumed is reduced whereas the
workflow efficiency is increased.
